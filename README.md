# Language Model-Driven Community Support Platform (LMD-CSP)

## Overview

The Language Model-Driven Community Support Platform (LMD-CSP) is a modular software platform designed to assist non-profit organizations in enhancing their community outreach and operations through the use of advanced language model capabilities. The platform is structured to provide support in several key areas: grant proposal writing, community engagement, educational content creation, volunteer management, and sentiment analysis.

## Key Components

### Grant Proposal Writing Helper
This component is aimed at assisting non-profit organizations in crafting well-structured grant proposals. By leveraging a large language model, it provides users with an outline for proposals based on specific topics, ensuring they have a strong foundation to build upon.

### Community Engagement Chatbot
The platform includes a chatbot that uses a language model to interact with community members effectively. This tool is designed to handle various queries in a conversational manner, providing information about services, events, and volunteer opportunities while learning from interactions to improve over time.

## Technical Requirements

The platform utilizes various libraries and APIs, including:
- **OpenAI** for leveraging language models.
- **TextBlob** for sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing sentiment data.

These technologies enable the platform to deliver intelligent and responsive solutions tailored to the needs of non-profit organizations.

## Usage

Each of the platform's components is encapsulated within its directory structure, with corresponding Python modules that provide the defined functionalities. Users are required to integrate their API keys and configure their SMTP credentials for email functionalities. The code is intended to be executed as a standalone application or can be integrated into existing systems as needed.

Overall, the LMD-CSP platform aims to empower non-profit organizations by providing scalable, advanced, and easy-to-use tools, ultimately enhancing their capability to serve and uplift their communities.
